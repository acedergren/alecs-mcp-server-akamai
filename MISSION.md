# Akamai MCP Server - Mission & Strategy

## Mission Statement

**Democratize Akamai CDN management by enabling developers to control their infrastructure through natural language conversations with AI, eliminating the complexity barrier between intention and execution.**

## Vision

Transform how developers interact with Akamai's powerful but complex CDN platform by creating the first AI-native management interface that understands context, remembers preferences, and executes multi-step operations through simple conversation.

## Core Values

1. **Simplicity First**: Complex operations should be as easy as describing what you want
2. **Developer Empathy**: Built by a developer who feels the pain, for developers who share it
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
4. **Open Innovation**: Open source core with sustainable growth path

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals (MVP - 3 months)
1. **Eliminate Context Switching**: Manage Akamai directly from Claude without opening multiple dashboards
2. **Natural Language Operations**: Deploy, configure, and troubleshoot using plain English
3. **Multi-Customer Support**: Seamlessly switch between client accounts in one interface
4. **80/20 Feature Coverage**: Support the 20% of features that handle 80% of daily tasks

### Secondary Goals (6-12 months)
1. **Community Building**: Foster contributor ecosystem around common Akamai patterns
2. **Enterprise Adoption**: Become the preferred tool for agencies managing multiple Akamai accounts
3. **Revenue Generation**: Premium features for teams and enterprises
4. **AI Learning**: Build knowledge base from successful operations

## Strategic Framework

### 1. User Journey Mapping

**Before (Current Pain)**
```
Developer → Opens Akamai UI → Navigates 5+ screens → Reads documentation → 
Makes API calls → Waits for activation → Checks multiple properties → Repeats
```

**After (With MCP)**
```
Developer → Opens Claude → "Deploy my staging config to production for client X" → Done
```

### 2. Development Philosophy

- **Start Narrow, Go Deep**: Property Manager + DNS first, perfect these before expanding
- **Real Problems First**: Every feature must solve an actual pain point the developer has experienced
- **Feedback Loops**: Ship early to beta users, iterate based on real usage
- **Documentation as Code**: AI-readable docs that Claude can use to self-improve

### 3. Technical Strategy

- **Modular Architecture**: Each Akamai service as a separate module
- **Credential Safety**: Secure multi-tenant credential management
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to direct API calls when AI struggles
- **Performance First**: Cache common operations, minimize API calls

### 4. Growth Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)**
- Core MCP server with Property Manager & DNS
- 5 beta users from personal network
- Weekly iteration based on feedback

**Phase 2: Expansion (Months 4-6)**
- Add FastPurge, Network Lists, SSL certificates
- Launch on Product Hunt, Dev.to articles
- 50 active users target

**Phase 3: Sustainability (Months 7-12)**
- Premium features: Team sharing, audit logs, bulk operations
- Enterprise pilot with 2-3 agencies
- 500 active users, 10 paying customers

## Success Metrics

### User Success
- **Time to First Value**: < 5 minutes from install to first successful operation
- **Task Completion Time**: 80% reduction vs Akamai UI for common tasks
- **User Retention**: 60% weekly active usage after 1 month

### Technical Success
- **API Coverage**: 20 most-used Akamai endpoints fully supported
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for read operations, < 10 seconds for writes
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for supported operations

### Business Success
- **Adoption**: 500 active developers by month 12
- **Revenue**: $5K MRR from premium features by month 12
- **Community**: 10 active contributors, 50 GitHub stars

## Competitive Advantages

1. **First Mover**: First MCP integration for Akamai
2. **AI-Native**: Built for AI from ground up, not bolted on
3. **Developer-Centric**: Built by someone who lives the problem daily
4. **Multi-Customer Focus**: Unique value prop for agencies and consultants

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Time Constraints**: Focus ruthlessly on MVP, say no to feature creep
2. **Akamai API Changes**: Abstract API layer, version lock dependencies
3. **Competition**: Move fast, build community moat
4. **Burnout**: Set sustainable pace, celebrate small wins

## The North Star

**When a developer thinks "I need to update my CDN config", their first instinct should be to ask Claude, not to open the Akamai console.**
