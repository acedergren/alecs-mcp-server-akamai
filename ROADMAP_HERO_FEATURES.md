## 📊 Example User Journey

### Before Hero Feature
```
1. User: Creates property
2. Error: "403 Forbidden"
3. User: "What does this mean?"
4. Google: 20 minutes searching
5. Support: Opens ticket
6. Wait: 2-4 hours
7. Support: "Try different contract"
8. User: Finally works
Total time: 4+ hours
```

### After Hero Feature
```
1. User: Creates property
2. Error: "403 Forbidden"
