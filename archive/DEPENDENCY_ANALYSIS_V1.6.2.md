# Dependency Analysis Report - v1.6.2

## Executive Summary

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of all 36 dependencies in the ALECS MCP Server project. Found opportunities to:
- Remove 4 unused dependencies
- Correct 3 misplaced dependencies
- Consider replacing 1 redundant dependency
- Investigate 1 potentially unused dependency

## Key Findings

### ðŸ”´ Unused Dependencies to Remove (4)

1. **@types/supertest** (devDependency)
   - No usage found in codebase
   - Safe to remove

2. **supertest** (devDependency)
   - No usage found in codebase
   - Types also unused
   - Safe to remove

3. **eslint-plugin-import** (devDependency)
   - Not configured in eslint.config.js
   - No usage found
   - Safe to remove

4. **tsconfig-paths** (devDependency)
   - No direct usage found
   - Not used in scripts or configuration
   - Safe to remove

### ðŸŸ¡ Dependencies to Move (3)

#### Move to devDependencies:
1. **@types/commander** (currently in dependencies)
   - Only provides TypeScript types
   - Should be in devDependencies

2. **@types/ws** (currently in dependencies)
   - Only provides TypeScript types
   - Should be in devDependencies

#### Move to dependencies:
3. **uuid** (currently in devDependencies)
   - Used in 3 production source files
   - Should be a runtime dependency

### ðŸŸ  Dependencies to Investigate (1)

1. **glob** (devDependency)
   - Search found 100+ matches but many appear to be false positives
   - Needs manual verification of actual usage
   - May be used in build scripts or file operations

### ðŸŸ¢ Dependencies to Consider Replacing (1)

1. **ts-node** (devDependency)
   - Only used in 1 file shebang (scripts/run-e2e-tests.ts)
   - Already have **tsx** which can serve the same purpose
   - Consider standardizing on tsx

## Dependency Health Summary

### Well-Placed Core Dependencies âœ…
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk - Core MCP functionality
- akamai-edgegrid - Akamai API authentication
- express - SSE transport
- ws - WebSocket transport
- zod - Runtime validation
- lru-cache - Performance optimization
- commander - CLI functionality

### Properly Configured Dev Dependencies âœ…
- TypeScript toolchain (typescript, ts-jest, tsx)
- Testing framework (jest, @jest/globals, jest-junit)
- Code quality (eslint, prettier, @typescript-eslint/*)
- Property testing (fast-check)
- JWT testing (jsonwebtoken)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Remove the 4 unused dependencies
2. **High Priority**: Fix dependency placement (move 3 packages)
3. **Medium Priority**: Investigate glob usage
4. **Low Priority**: Consider ts-node replacement

## Impact Analysis

### Package Size Reduction
- Removing unused dependencies will reduce node_modules size
- Moving type definitions to devDependencies prevents them from being included in production builds

### Clarity Improvement
- Proper separation of runtime vs development dependencies
- Cleaner dependency tree for production deployments

### Maintenance Benefits
- Fewer dependencies to update and audit
- Reduced attack surface (fewer packages in production)

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# Remove unused dependencies
npm uninstall @types/supertest supertest eslint-plugin-import tsconfig-paths

# Move type definitions to devDependencies
npm uninstall @types/commander @types/ws
npm install --save-dev @types/commander @types/ws

# Move uuid to dependencies
npm uninstall uuid
npm install uuid

# Verify and audit
npm audit
npm list --depth=0
```

## Next Steps

1. Execute the dependency cleanup commands
2. Run full test suite to ensure nothing breaks
3. Build the project to verify TypeScript compilation
4. Update CI/CD if any scripts depend on removed packages
5. Consider creating a script to periodically audit for unused dependencies
