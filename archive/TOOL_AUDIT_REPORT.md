# Comprehensive Tool Audit Report for ALECS MCP Server

## Executive Summary

This audit analyzed **59 TypeScript tool files** in the ALECS MCP Server codebase, revealing:
- **158 tools registered** in `all-tools-registry.ts` (but registry is unused)
- **7 primary Akamai APIs** integrated
- **Significant duplication** in property management tools
- **Mock implementations** in reporting tools
- **Unused tool registry** that should be integrated or removed

## Key Findings

### 1. Tool Discovery Results

**Total Tool Files**: 59 TypeScript files in `/src/tools/`
- Property Management: 11 files
- DNS Tools: 5 files  
- Certificate/CPS: 3 files
- Security Tools: 7 files (in security/ subdirectory)
- Analysis Tools: 5 files
- Elicitation Tools: 3 files
- Other Specialized: 25 files

### 2. API Mapping Summary

| Akamai API | Endpoint Pattern | Tool Count | Status |
|------------|------------------|------------|---------|
| Property Manager (PAPI) | `/papi/v1/` | 14+ tools | Active |
| Edge DNS | `/config-dns/v2/` | 5 tools | Active |
| CPS | `/cps/v2/` | 4 tools | Active |
| Fast Purge | `/ccu/v3/` | 1 tool | Active |
| Network Lists | `/network-list/v2/` | 5 tools | Active |
| AppSec | `/appsec/v1/` | 6 tools | Active |
| Reporting | `/reporting-api/v1/` | 14 tools | **Mocked** |

### 3. Critical Issues

#### A. Unused Tool Registry
- `all-tools-registry.ts` registers 158 tools but **is not imported anywhere**
- The main server uses `modular-server-factory.ts` with only minimal tools
- Individual servers have their own tool registrations

#### B. Duplicate Tools
**Property Management Duplicates**:
- `property-manager-tools.ts`
- `property-tools.ts` 
- `property-manager.ts`
- `property-manager-advanced-tools.ts`

All implement similar functionality with overlapping features.

#### C. Fake/Mock Tools
**Reporting Tools** - All 14 reporting tools appear to use mock data:
- Generate synthetic responses
- No real Akamai Reporting API calls
- Should be clearly marked as demo/test tools

#### D. Commented Out But Valid Tools
These tools exist but are commented out in the registry:
- `generateASNSecurityRecommendations` (network-lists-geo-asn.ts:390)
- `listCommonGeographicCodes` (network-lists-geo-asn.ts:499)
- `dnsElicitationTool` (elicitation/index.ts)
- `secureHostnameOnboardingTool` (elicitation/index.ts)

### 4. Import Analysis

**Used Imports**: 158 tools properly imported and registered
**Unused Imports**: 0 (all imported tools are registered)
**Missing Imports**: 4 tools commented out but actually exist
**Circular Dependencies**: None detected

### 5. Tools Slated for Deletion

Based on the audit, these tools should be considered for removal:

#### Duplicate Tools to Consolidate:
1. `property-manager.ts` - Merge into `property-manager-tools.ts`
2. `property-tools.ts` - Basic operations already in advanced tools
3. Backup files: `*.backup-before-cleanup` files

#### Mock Tools to Remove or Clearly Mark:
1. All 14 reporting tools if they don't provide real functionality
2. Performance tools if they only generate synthetic data

#### Obsolete Tools:
1. Workflow assistants (already removed per comments)
2. Consolidated tools (marked as "sophisticated fakes")

### 6. Missing Tool Registrations

Tools that exist but aren't in the active registry:
1. Network Lists Integration tools
2. Some security policy tools
3. Advanced DNS migration tools

### 7. API Coverage Gaps

No tools found for these Akamai APIs:
- Image & Video Manager API
- Bot Manager API  
- API Gateway
- mPulse API
- DataStream API

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Decide on all-tools-registry.ts**:
   - Either integrate it into the main server
   - Or remove it to avoid confusion

2. **Uncomment Valid Tools**:
   ```typescript
   // These should be uncommented in all-tools-registry.ts
   import {
     generateASNSecurityRecommendations,
     listCommonGeographicCodes,
   } from './security/network-lists-geo-asn';
   
   import {
     dnsElicitationTool,
     secureHostnameOnboardingTool,
   } from './elicitation';
   ```

3. **Consolidate Duplicate Tools**:
   - Create one comprehensive property management tool
   - Merge DNS tool variants
   - Remove redundant implementations

4. **Handle Mock Tools**:
   - Clearly mark mock/demo tools
   - Move to a separate demo/ directory
   - Or remove if not needed

### Long-term Improvements:

1. **Standardize Tool Structure**:
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Unified handler patterns
   - Clear API version documentation

2. **Improve Organization**:
   - One tool file per Akamai API service
   - Shared utilities for common operations
   - Clear separation of real vs mock implementations

3. **Expand API Coverage**:
   - Add Image & Video Manager tools
   - Implement Bot Manager integration
   - Add DataStream log delivery tools

## Conclusion

The codebase has extensive Akamai API integration but suffers from organizational issues. The main problem is the disconnect between the comprehensive tool registry and the actual server implementation. Addressing the duplicate tools and clarifying mock vs real implementations would significantly improve maintainability.

**Total Registered Tools**: 158 (in unused registry)
**Total Active Tools**: ~20-30 (in modular-server-factory.ts)
**Tools Needing Deletion**: ~20-30 (duplicates and obsolete)
**Tools Needing Import**: 4-6 (commented but valid)
