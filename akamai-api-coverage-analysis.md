## Gap Analysis

### Critical Missing Functionality

1. **Global Traffic Management (GTM)**: No coverage of gtm-api or gtm-load-data
2. **EdgeWorkers & EdgeKV**: No edge computing capabilities
3. **Image & Video Manager**: No imaging API coverage
4. **Cloudlets**: No application layer optimization
5. **Contract & Billing**: No contract-api or invoicing coverage
6. **DataStream**: No datastream-config-api coverage
7. **Site Shield**: No siteshield coverage
8. **NetStorage**: No storage or netstorage-usage-api coverage

### Tool Count Discrepancy Analysis

**Expected vs Actual Tool Distribution**:
- **Property Manager (PAPI)**: Should have 50+ tools (complex API with many endpoints)
- **DNS**: Should have 20+ tools (zone management, record types, etc.)
- **Security**: Should have 30+ tools across multiple security APIs
- **Media**: Should have 15+ tools (missing entirely)
- **Edge Computing**: Should have 20+ tools (missing entirely)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Restore Missing Tools**: Review git history to identify accidentally deleted tools
2. **Audit Consolidation**: Verify no functionality was lost during consolidation
3. **Prioritize Core APIs**: Focus on restoring the most critical missing APIs first

### Implementation Priority

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (High Priority)
- Global Traffic Management (gtm-api)
- EdgeWorkers & EdgeKV
- Image & Video Manager
- Contract Management
- DataStream Configuration

#### Phase 2: Security & Access (Medium Priority)
- Cloud Access Manager
- IP Protection
- Enterprise Threat Protector
- Firewall Rules Manager

#### Phase 3: Media & Delivery (Medium Priority)
- Media Live Configuration
- Media Delivery Reports
- Live Archive

#### Phase 4: Developer & Testing (Low Priority)
- Sandbox API
- Test Management
- Testing as a Service

## Detailed Analysis of Tool Consolidation Impact

### What Was Actually Lost vs Consolidated

**Good News**: Core CP Code functionality was preserved and moved to utilities tools:
- `cpcode_list` - List CP codes (consolidated from 566-line cpcode-tools.ts)
- `cpcode_create` - Create CP codes
- CP Code functionality also appears in property and certificate tools

**Concerning Findings**:
- 126 tool files were deleted during consolidation
- Many specialized tools appear to have been eliminated rather than consolidated
- Some deleted tools included:
  - `advanced-property-tools.ts` - Advanced property management
  - `certificate-enrollment-tools.ts` - Certificate enrollment workflows
  - `edge-hostname-management.ts` - Edge hostname operations
  - `includes-tools.ts` - Property includes management
  - `rule-tree-advanced.ts` - Advanced rule tree operations
  - Multiple security tool files with granular functionality

### Tool Distribution Analysis

**Property Manager (PAPI) - Severely Underrepresented**:
- **Current**: 9 tools
- **Should Have**: 50+ tools (PAPI is Akamai's most complex API)
- **Missing**: Advanced rule tree operations, includes management, edge hostname management, bulk operations

**Security Tools - Partially Consolidated**:
- **Current**: 44 tools (10 security + 34 AppSec)
- **Issues**: Many granular network-list operations were deleted
- **Missing**: Individual security tool files that provided specialized functionality

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Restore Critical Missing Tools
- [ ] Advanced property management tools
- [ ] Edge hostname management
- [ ] Property includes management
- [ ] Advanced rule tree operations
- [ ] Granular network list operations

### 2. Implement Missing API Families (Priority Order)
1. **Global Traffic Management (gtm-api, gtm-load-data)**
2. **EdgeWorkers & EdgeKV**
3. **Image & Video Manager (imaging)**
4. **Cloudlets**
5. **Contract Management (contract-api)**
6. **DataStream (datastream-config-api)**
7. **Site Shield (siteshield)**
8. **NetStorage (storage, netstorage-usage-api)**

### 3. Address Architecture Gaps
- [ ] Review all 126 deleted tool files to identify lost functionality
- [ ] Implement missing endpoints from the 49 uncovered API families
- [ ] Restore specialized tools that were over-consolidated

## Conclusion

**Critical Status**: We have lost substantial functionality during consolidation. While basic operations are preserved, many advanced and specialized tools were eliminated.

**Coverage Gap**: 86% of official Akamai APIs (49 out of 57) are completely missing from our implementation.

**Action Required**: Immediate restoration of deleted functionality and implementation of missing API families. The consolidation was too aggressive and eliminated tools that provided unique value.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Audit all deleted tools for unique functionality
2. Implement the 8 priority API families listed above
3. Restore advanced property management capabilities
4. Gradually add remaining 41 missing API families
