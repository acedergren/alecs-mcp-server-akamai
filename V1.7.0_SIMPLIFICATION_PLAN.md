# v1.7.0 - True Snow Leopard Simplification Plan

## Learning from PR #44

PR #44 taught us valuable lessons about scope creep. It started with good intentions (simplify!) but became a 20,000+ line monster that added complexity instead of removing it.

## The Right Approach: Small, Focused PRs

### ðŸ“‹ PR 1: Emoji Removal
**Goal**: Remove emojis from 28 TypeScript files  
**Scope**: ONLY emoji removal, no other changes  
**Script**: 
```bash
# Find and replace emojis with text equivalents
find src -name "*.ts" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/ðŸŽ¯/[TARGET]/g' {} \;
find src -name "*.ts" -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/âœ…/[OK]/g' {} \;
# ... etc
```

### ðŸ“‹ PR 2: Entry Point Consolidation
**Goal**: Reduce from 15 entry points to 2  
**Scope**: 
- Keep: `src/index.ts` (full server)
- Keep: `src/index-minimal.ts` (lightweight)
- Remove: 13 individual server files
- Update: package.json and docs

### ðŸ“‹ PR 3: NPM Script Cleanup
**Goal**: Reduce from 27 to ~20 scripts  
**Scope**:
- Remove duplicate scripts
- Consolidate similar commands
- Update documentation

## Success Criteria

Each PR must:
- âœ… Actually REMOVE things (not add)
- âœ… Be reviewable in < 30 minutes
- âœ… Have a single, clear purpose
- âœ… Be mergeable independently

## Timeline

- Week 1: Emoji removal
- Week 2: Entry point consolidation
- Week 3: NPM script cleanup

Small steps, real progress, no scope creep!
