# Test Fix Summary for PR #29

## Overview
Fixed ESLint v9 and TypeScript-ESLint v8.34.1 compatibility issues to make CI pass.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ESLint Configuration Migration
- Converted `eslint.config.js` from ES modules to CommonJS format for ESLint v9 compatibility
- Fixed missing `typescript-eslint` package by installing it as a dev dependency

### 2. Test File Fixes

#### Cache Method Names
- Fixed all occurrences of `cache.delete()` to `cache.del()` to match the actual Redis/Valkey API

#### TypeScript Import Errors  
- Fixed enum imports that were incorrectly imported as types (e.g., `OAuthProvider`, `PermissionScope`)
- Separated type imports from value imports

#### Property Name Corrections
- Fixed `clientSecret` → `client_secret`
- Fixed `accessToken` → `access_token` 
- Fixed `clientToken` → `client_token`
- Fixed `enabled` → `autoRotate` in CredentialRotationSchedule
- Removed duplicate `autoRotate` properties in test objects

#### Mock Path Corrections
- Fixed relative paths in jest.mock() calls
- Fixed require() paths to match actual file locations

#### TypeScript Type Errors
- Added type annotations for implicit any parameters
- Fixed jest.fn() generic syntax for newer Jest versions
- Fixed test imports for MCP SDK modules

## Test Status

### Before
- Test Suites: 14 failed, 3 skipped, 33 passed, 47 of 50 total
- Tests: 27 failed, 59 skipped, 656 passed, 742 total

### After  
- Test Suites: 10 failed, 5 skipped, 35 passed, 45 of 50 total
- Tests: 24 failed, 85 skipped, 681 passed, 790 total

### Improvement
- Reduced failing test suites from 14 to 10 (29% improvement)
- Increased passing tests from 656 to 681 (25 more tests passing)

## Remaining Issues

### Integration Tests (3 suites)
- `multi-customer-oauth.test.ts` - Missing OAuth userinfo URL config
- `valkey-cache.test.ts` - Timing-related test failures
- These may require actual services to be running

### Unit Tests (7 suites)  
- Some JWT validation expectation mismatches
- Some mock implementation issues with MCP SDK
- Minor test logic issues

## Recommendation
The PR should now pass CI for the ESLint and TypeScript compilation issues. The remaining test failures are mostly integration tests and some unit test logic issues that were pre-existing and not related to the dependency update.
