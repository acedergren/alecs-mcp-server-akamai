```bash
# Fork and clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alecs-mcp-server-akamai.git
cd alecs-mcp-server-akamai

# Complete setup (includes dependency checks)
make setup

# Start development
make dev
```

## How to Contribute

â€¢ Create utility functions for batch operations
â€¢ Write integration tests for specific Akamai APIs
â€¢ Improve TypeScript type definitions for API responses

### What We're Looking For

**Code Contributions**: TypeScript implementations of Akamai APIs, test coverage, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

**Real-World Testing**: Use the tools with your actual Akamai accounts and configurations. Report issues with specific error messages and steps to reproduce.

**Documentation**: Examples, tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and API reference improvements. Documentation that helps people solve real problems.

**User Experience**: Suggestions for better workflows, more intuitive tool names, clearer error messages, and smoother multi-customer management.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

â€¢ Node.js 20+ and npm
â€¢ Access to an Akamai account with API credentials
â€¢ `.edgerc` file configured with your credentials

Check prerequisites: `make check-deps`

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Complete Setup**:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

2. **Configure Akamai Credentials**:
   Set up your `.edgerc` file with multiple customer sections:
   ```ini
   [default]
   client_secret = your_client_secret
   host = akaa-xxxxxx.luna.akamaiapis.net
   access_token = your_access_token
   client_token = your_client_token
   
   [customer1]
   client_secret = customer1_secret
   host = akaa-yyyyyy.luna.akamaiapis.net
   access_token = customer1_token
   client_token = customer1_token
   account_switch_key = customer1_switch_key
   ```

3. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Quick development cycle
make dev              # Start with hot reload
make dev-check        # Run all checks quickly
make test-watch       # Run tests in watch mode

# Quality checks
make lint             # Check code style
make typecheck        # TypeScript validation
make test             # Run full test suite
make validate         # Run all checks

# Debugging
make debug            # Run with Node.js debugger
make inspect          # Run with Chrome DevTools
make trace            # Run with trace warnings
```

### Code Standards

**Keep It Simple**: This is a solo developer project. Complex solutions should be the exception, not the rule.

**TypeScript First**: Strong typing helps catch errors early. Add types for all Akamai API responses.

**Test What Matters**: Focus tests on API integration, multi-customer scenarios, and error handling. Don't test every getter and setter.

**Error Messages**: Make them helpful. "Invalid DNS record" isn't helpful. "DNS record type 'XYZ' is not supported. Valid types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX" is helpful.

**Multi-Customer Aware**: Every tool should accept a `customer` parameter and handle customer context switching gracefully.

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

**MCP Tools** (`src/tools/`): Each Akamai service has its own tool module:
â€¢ `property-tools.ts` - CDN property management
â€¢ `dns-tools.ts` - Edge DNS operations  
â€¢ `certificate-tools.ts` - SSL/TLS certificate management
â€¢ `purge-tools.ts` - Content invalidation
â€¢ `security-tools.ts` - WAF and security policies

**Customer Management** (`src/customer/`): Handles multi-tenant credential switching and validation.

**Akamai Client** (`src/akamai-client.ts`): EdgeGrid authentication and API communication wrapper.

### Adding New Tools

1. **Create the Tool Module**:
   ```bash
   make new-tool NAME=my-feature
   ```

2. **Implement the Tool**:
   ```typescript
   export const myFeatureTools = [
     {
       name: 'service.action',
       description: 'What this tool does',
       inputSchema: {
         type: 'object',
         properties: {
           customer: { type: 'string', description: 'Customer name' },
           // ... other parameters
         },
         required: ['customer']
       }
     }
   ];
   ```

3. **Register in Main Index**: Add your tools to `src/index.ts`

4. **Add Tests**: Create `src/tools/__tests__/my-feature-tools.test.ts`

### API Integration Pattern

1. **Research First**: Check Akamai's OpenAPI specs on GitHub for accurate endpoint details
2. **Type the Response**: Create TypeScript interfaces for all API responses  
3. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling and user-friendly messages
4. **Support Multi-Customer**: Always accept and handle customer parameters
5. **Test Integration**: Write tests that verify actual API communication

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
make test              # Full test suite
make test-watch        # Watch mode for development
make test-coverage     # Generate coverage report
make test-single FILE=path/to/test.ts  # Run specific test
```

### What to Test

**Critical Paths**:
â€¢ Multi-customer credential switching
â€¢ API authentication and error handling
â€¢ Core workflows (property deployment, DNS updates, certificate enrollment)

**Integration Tests**:
â€¢ Real API calls against Akamai's staging environment
â€¢ Error handling for rate limits and API failures
â€¢ Customer context isolation

**Unit Tests**:
â€¢ Input validation
â€¢ Response parsing
â€¢ Configuration handling

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('DNS Tools', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  });

  it('should list zones for specified customer', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle API errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Error handling test
  });
});
```

## Getting Help

### Common Issues

**Authentication Problems**: Check your `.edgerc` configuration and account permissions. The `make validate-edgerc` command helps diagnose issues.

**Multi-Customer Context**: Every tool should accept a `customer` parameter. If you're getting "access denied" errors, verify the customer name matches your `.edgerc` sections.

**API Rate Limits**: Akamai APIs have rate limits. Implement exponential backoff and don't make unnecessary API calls during development.

**TypeScript Errors**: Run `make typecheck` to see detailed error messages. Most TypeScript issues are related to missing API response types.

### Getting Support

â€¢ **GitHub Issues**: For bugs, feature requests, and general questions
â€¢ **GitHub Discussions**: For architecture questions and community discussion
â€¢ **Code Review**: Submit draft PRs early if you want feedback on approach

## Code of Conduct

**Be Direct**: Skip the pleasantries. Focus on the problem and the solution.

**Be Helpful**: Share specific examples, error messages, and code snippets. Vague descriptions don't help anyone.

**Be Patient**: This is a solo developer project. Response times may vary, but every contribution is valued.

**Be Practical**: Solutions should solve real problems, not theoretical ones. If you can't explain why someone would use a feature, maybe it doesn't belong.
