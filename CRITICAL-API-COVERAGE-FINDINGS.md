# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL API COVERAGE FINDINGS

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The tool consolidation process has eliminated 66% of our functionality (287 â†’ 98 tools) and we're missing 86% of official Akamai APIs.

## Key Findings

### 1. Massive Functionality Loss
- **126 tool files deleted** during consolidation
- **189 tools eliminated** (not just consolidated)
- Many specialized tools completely removed

### 2. Severe API Coverage Gap
- **57 official Akamai API families** exist
- **Only 8 API families covered** (14% coverage)
- **49 API families completely missing** (86% gap)

### 3. Critical Missing APIs
- **Global Traffic Management** (gtm-api, gtm-load-data)
- **EdgeWorkers & EdgeKV** (edge computing)
- **Image & Video Manager** (imaging)
- **Cloudlets** (application optimization)
- **Contract Management** (contract-api)
- **DataStream** (datastream-config-api)
- **Site Shield** (siteshield)
- **NetStorage** (storage, netstorage-usage-api)

### 4. Property Manager Severely Underrepresented
- **Current**: 9 tools
- **Should Have**: 50+ tools (PAPI is Akamai's most complex API)
- **Lost**: Advanced rule tree, includes management, edge hostname management

## Impact Analysis

### What We Lost
- Advanced property management capabilities
- Edge hostname operations
- Property includes management
- Granular security operations
- Specialized certificate workflows
- Advanced rule tree operations

### What We Kept
- Basic property operations
- Basic DNS operations
- Basic certificate operations
- Basic security operations
- CP Code management (consolidated)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. URGENT: Restore Critical Tools
- [ ] Advanced property management tools
- [ ] Edge hostname management
- [ ] Property includes management
- [ ] Advanced rule tree operations

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY: Implement Missing Core APIs
1. Global Traffic Management
2. EdgeWorkers & EdgeKV
3. Image & Video Manager
4. Cloudlets
5. Contract Management

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Expand Coverage
- Review 126 deleted tool files
- Implement remaining 44 missing API families
- Restore specialized functionality

## Recommendation

**STOP current development** and immediately address this critical gap. The consolidation was too aggressive and eliminated essential functionality that users depend on. We need to restore missing tools and implement the 49 missing API families to provide comprehensive Akamai API coverage.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Restore the most critical deleted tools
2. **This Week**: Implement GTM, EdgeWorkers, and Image Manager APIs
3. **This Month**: Achieve 50% API family coverage (29 out of 57)
4. **Next Month**: Achieve 80% API family coverage (45 out of 57)
