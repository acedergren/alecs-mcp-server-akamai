# API Compliance Analysis Report

## Date: 2025-07-04

### Overview
The audit found 1,268 API compliance issues, with 76 marked as critical. After detailed analysis, many of these are false positives or issues in documentation/test files.

## Critical Issues Analysis

### 1. Duplicate Tool Names (RESOLVED)
**Finding**: Audit flagged duplicate names like 'caching', 'gzipResponse', etc.
**Analysis**: These are not MCP tool names but Akamai rule tree behavior names, which are supposed to be repeated across different rules.
**Status**: ‚úÖ No action needed - false positive

### 2. Tool Names with Dots (RESOLVED)
**Finding**: Audit flagged names like 'www.example.com', 'Amazon.com, Inc.'
**Analysis**: These appear in:
- Comments and documentation examples
- ASN provider names (which are display strings, not tool names)
- Example code snippets
**Status**: ‚úÖ No action needed - false positive

### 3. Customer Parameter Validation (PARTIALLY RESOLVED)
**Finding**: Tools using customer parameter without validation
**Analysis**: FastPurge tools already validate customer parameter properly. Most high-priority tools have validation.
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to verify remaining tools

### 4. Account Switching Validation (NEEDS INVESTIGATION)
**Finding**: Account switching without validation in multiple files
**Analysis**: This appears to be checking for proper validation of account-switch-key header
**Status**: üîç Requires deeper investigation

### 5. Hardcoded Secrets (RESOLVED)
**Finding**: Potential hardcoded secrets in test files
**Analysis**: These are test credentials in test setup files, which is acceptable
**Status**: ‚úÖ No action needed - test credentials

### 6. Command Injection (RESOLVED)
**Finding**: Potential command injection vulnerability
**Analysis**: The flagged file is actually the fix for command injection, not the vulnerability
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already fixed

## Real Issues Identified

### 1. Error Format Compliance
All errors are already using RFC 7807 Problem Details format through BaseAkamaiClient and enhanced error handling.
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already compliant

### 2. MCP Response Format
All tools already return proper MCP format with `content` and `type: 'text'`.
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already compliant

### 3. Response Validation
BaseAkamaiClient already has Zod schema validation built in.
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already compliant

### 4. Tool Input Schemas
All tools already have proper input schemas defined.
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already compliant

## Recommendations

1. **Update Audit Rules**: Many false positives suggest the audit rules need refinement:
   - Exclude comments and documentation from tool name checks
   - Distinguish between MCP tools and Akamai API behaviors
   - Better detection of test vs production code

2. **Customer Validation**: While most tools validate customer, we should:
   - Create a standard validation middleware
   - Apply it consistently across all tools

3. **Account Switching**: Need to investigate what specific validation is missing

## Conclusion

The vast majority of "critical" API compliance issues are false positives. The codebase already implements:
- ‚úÖ Proper error formatting (RFC 7807)
- ‚úÖ Correct MCP response format
- ‚úÖ Response validation with Zod
- ‚úÖ Input schema validation
- ‚úÖ Customer parameter validation (in most places)

The real work needed is minimal compared to what the audit suggests.
