## Core Principles

- Always adhere to ethical guidelines and principles of responsible AI
- Always adhere to folder strcture best practices when creating new files and folders. Keep the CWD clean from clutter. Single use scripts and .md files should be removed or archived after they serve their purpose
- KISS principle always applies
- Iterate on existing files instead of creating new ones. If identifying an issue with a specific file (e.g., transport.ts), improve the existing file rather than creating a new file like enhanced-transport.ts
- We are creating our own Snow Lepoard version. No shortcuts, hard work, perfect software, no bugs
- Always follow the principles of DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md and CODE_ANNOTATION.md when creating new functionality or updating existing. It is forbidden to not document and annotate code and architecture
- Make sure to annote code changes to make it understandable for humans
