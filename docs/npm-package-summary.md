# After global install

# Or with npx (no install needed)
npx alecs-mcp-server-akamai
```

### 2. Modular Servers
The NPM package includes all server variants accessible via subcommands:

```bash
# Property Management (32 tools)
alecs start:property

# DNS Management (24 tools)
alecs start:dns

# Certificate Management (22 tools)
alecs start:certs

# Reporting (25 tools)

## Docker Images

Docker images are built via GitHub Actions but currently only the main tag is published:
- `acedergren/alecs-mcp-server-akamai:latest`
- `acedergren/alecs-mcp-server-akamai:1.7.3`

The CI/CD workflow is configured to build variants (-modular, -websocket, -sse) but they may not be pushed due to Docker Hub authentication issues.

## Documentation Updates

1. **README.md** - Updated Quick Start section to show modular server usage
2. **npm-variants-guide.md** - Created comprehensive guide for all NPM variants
3. **alecs-cli-wrapper.ts** - Created CLI wrapper to handle start: commands
4. **package.json** - Updated bin entry to use the CLI wrapper

## Implementation Details

The modular servers are implemented as:
1. Separate TypeScript files in `src/servers/` directory
2. Compiled to `dist/servers/` during build
3. Accessible via the main `alecs` CLI command with `start:` subcommands
4. Each server runs independently with its own tool subset

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify all start: commands work correctly after npm publish
2. **Docker**: Fix Docker Hub authentication to publish variant images
3. **Documentation**: Add examples of using modular servers with different AI tools
4. **Monitoring**: Track which variants are most popular with users
