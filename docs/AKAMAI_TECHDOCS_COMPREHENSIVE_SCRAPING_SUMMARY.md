# Akamai TechDocs Comprehensive Scraping Summary

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes all findings from comprehensive scraping of Akamai TechDocs, covering critical API quirks, workflow complexities, and implementation requirements across all major Akamai services.

## Domains Scraped and Key Findings

### 1. Property Manager (PAPI) ✓
**Purpose**: Manage CDN properties and configurations

**Critical Findings**:
- **Contract/Group Dependency Hell**: Most endpoints require both contractId and groupId, but discovering these is circular
- **Version Management**: Cannot edit active versions - must create new version first
- **Activation Times**: 
  - Staging: 3 minutes (typical)
  - Production: 15 minutes (typical)
  - First-time or hostname changes: ~1 hour
- **11-Step Workflow**: From certificate prep to DNS update

**API Quirks**:
- Need contractId to get groups, but groups endpoint requires contractId (circular!)
- Some "warnings" actually block activation
- Can't activate same version twice
- Default rules added automatically by products

### 2. Edge DNS ✓
**Purpose**: Manage DNS zones and records

**Critical Findings**:
- **Changelist Workflow Required**: Cannot update records directly
- **5-Step Process**: Create changelist → Add zone → Modify → Submit → Activate
- **Zone Types**:
  - Primary: Full control
  - Secondary: Limited modifications (some bypass changelist)
  - Alias: Points to other zones
- **Changelist Expiry**: 10 minutes of inactivity

**API Quirks**:
- Must discard failed changelists manually
- Activation can be async (returns 202)
- Some secondary zone edits bypass changelist mechanism

### 3. Certificate Provisioning System (CPS) ✓
**Purpose**: Provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates

**Critical Findings**:
- **11-Step Automated Workflow**: From CSR to production deployment
- **Validation Types**:
  - DNS: Required for wildcards
  - HTTP: Fails if site redirects to HTTPS
- **Auto-renewal**: 60 days before expiry (20 for DV)
- **Network Selection**: Enhanced TLS recommended over Standard TLS

**API Quirks**:
- DNS validation records must exist BEFORE checking
- 7 days before expiry, staging auto-deploys to production
- "Always Test on Staging" option requires manual approval

### 4. CP Codes ✓
**Purpose**: Identify traffic for reporting, billing, and monitoring

**Critical Findings**:
- **Creation Limitation**: CP Code API is read-only
- **Must Use Property Manager**: To create new CP codes
- **Deletion Unavailable**: Cannot delete CP codes
- **Reporting Groups**: Organize for flexible invoicing

**API Quirks**:
- API only supports listing and updating, not creation
- Automatically assigned when creating properties

### 5. Edge Hostnames ✓
**Purpose**: Map domains to Akamai edge network

**Critical Findings**:
- **Domain Suffix Options**:
  - `edgesuite.net`: Legacy, Standard TLS or HTTP only
  - `edgekey.net`: Modern, Enhanced TLS, HTTP/2 support
  - `akamaized.net`: Shared certificate, quick setup
  - `-staging.net` variants for testing
- **Cannot Change Suffix**: After creation
- **Creation**: In Property Manager, management in Edge Hostname Editor

**API Quirks**:
- Suffix determines available features permanently
- Some suffixes require special contracts
- Staging suffixes don't work in production

### 6. Fast Purge ✓
**Purpose**: Refresh cached content

**Critical Findings**:
- **Purge Methods**: Invalidate or delete
- **Categories**: URL, ARL, CP Code, Cache Tag
- **URL Encoding Rules**:
  - Encode spaces: YES (`%20`)
  - Encode protocol: NO (keep `https://`)
- **Should Not Replace TTL**: Proper cache headers preferred

**API Quirks**:
- Different encoding rules for URLs vs CP codes
- Tag purging affects unknown content
- Rate limits per type
- Staging purge doesn't always reflect prod

### 7. Reporting ✓
**Purpose**: Traffic and performance analytics

**Critical Findings**:
- **Data Intervals**: 5 minutes to monthly
- **Data Lag Times**: Varies by report type
- **Report Types**: Traffic, Edge DNS, Security, Performance
- **API Versions**: v1 (stable), v2 (enhanced)

**API Quirks**:
- Must adjust end time for data lag to avoid empty results
- Different dimensions available for different time ranges
- Stricter rate limits for detailed data

### 8. Network Lists ✓
**Purpose**: Manage IP allowlists and blocklists

**Critical Findings**:
- **Fast Activation**: Typically less than 10 minutes
- **Shared Lists**: Across security products
- **Types**: IP addresses, CIDR blocks, geographic areas
- **Akamai-Managed Lists**: TOR nodes, cloud providers

**API Quirks**:
- Can't modify list during activation
- Activation to prod may require staging first
- Rollback creates new activation, not instant

### 9. Global Traffic Management (GTM) ✓
**Purpose**: Global load balancing and failover

**Critical Findings**:
- **Not Regular Properties**: These are load balancing configurations
- **Load Balancing Types**: 
  - Weighted round-robin
  - Performance-based
  - Geographic
- **Liveness Tests**: Required and run from multiple locations
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Cloud-based intelligent routing

**API Quirks**:
- Test failures affect traffic immediately
- Can't delete property with active traffic
- Handout limits affect failover behavior
- "Properties" in GTM are NOT Property Manager properties!

## Cross-Domain Complexities

### 1. New Site Deployment
Requires coordination across:
- Property Manager (create property)
- Edge Hostnames (create edge hostname)
- CPS (provision certificate)
- DNS (update records)
- Security (configure WAF)

### 2. Common ID Translation Needs
- Property IDs → Property Names
- Contract IDs → Contract Names
- Group IDs → Group Names
- CP Codes → Descriptive Names
- Network List IDs → List Names
- EdgeWorker IDs → Worker Names
- Certificate Enrollment IDs → Domain Names

### 3. Activation Patterns
Different services have different activation requirements:
- Properties: Staging recommended before production
- DNS: Changelist workflow required
- Network Lists: Fast activation (~10 min)
- Certificates: Multi-step validation process

## Implementation Recommendations
