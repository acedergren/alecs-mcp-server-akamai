Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that
enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and
tools Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating
custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context
they need
- ​Overview
MCP provides a standardized way for applications to:

Share contextual information with language models
Expose tools and capabilities to AI systems
Build composable integrations and workflows

The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to establish
communication between:

Hosts: LLM applications that initiate connections
Clients: Connectors within the host application
Servers: Services that provide context and capabilities

MCP takes some inspiration from the
Language Server Protocol, which
standardizes how to add support for programming languages across a whole ecosystem of
development tools In a similar way, MCP standardizes how to integrate additional context
and tools into the ecosystem of AI applications
- ​Key Details
​Base Protocol

JSON-RPC message format
Stateful connections
Server and client capability negotiation

​Features
Servers offer any of the following features to clients:

Resources: Context and data, for the user or the AI model to use
Prompts: Templated messages and workflows for users
Tools: Functions for the AI model to execute

Clients may offer the following features to servers:

Sampling: Server-initiated agentic behaviors and recursive LLM interactions
Roots: Server-initiated inquiries into uri or filesystem boundaries to operate in
Elicitation: Server-initiated requests for additional information from users

​Additional Utilities

Configuration
Progress tracking
Cancellation
Error reporting
Logging

​Security and Trust & Safety
The Model Context Protocol enables powerful capabilities through arbitrary data access
and code execution paths With this power comes important security and trust
considerations that all implementors must carefully address
- ​Key Principles


User Consent and Control

Users must explicitly consent to and understand all data access and operations
Users must retain control over what data is shared and what actions are taken
Implementors should provide clear UIs for reviewing and authorizing activities



Data Privacy

Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before exposing user data to servers
Hosts must not transmit resource data elsewhere without user consent
User data should be protected with appropriate access controls



Tool Safety

Tools represent arbitrary code execution and must be treated with appropriate
caution In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be
considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server
- In particular, descriptions of tool behavior such as annotations should be
considered untrusted, unless obtained from a trusted server Hosts must obtain explicit user consent before invoking any tool
Users should understand what each tool does before authorizing its use



LLM Sampling Controls

Users must explicitly approve any LLM sampling requests
Users should control:

Whether sampling occurs at all
The actual prompt that will be sent
What results the server can see


The protocol intentionally limits server visibility into prompts



​Implementation Guidelines
While MCP itself cannot enforce these security principles at the protocol level,
implementors SHOULD:

Build robust consent and authorization flows into their applications
Provide clear documentation of security implications
Implement appropriate access controls and data protections
Follow security best practices in their integrations
Consider privacy implications in their feature designs

## ALECS Compliance Assessment

### Current ALECS Implementation

#### Tool Naming
- **Current Pattern**: Dot notation (e.g., `property.list`, `dns.zone.create`)
- **Total Tools**: 287
- **Naming Convention**: Hierarchical domain.subdomain.action

#### Server Behavior
- **Framework**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server
- **Transport**: StdioServerTransport
- **Tool Registration**: Dynamic via tool registry
- **Validation**: Custom tool name validation with regex pattern

#### Client Support
- **Test Implementation**: Direct MCP SDK client testing
- **Transport Support**: Stdio and WebSocket
- **Multi-tenant**: Customer isolation support

### Compliance Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **Tool Naming**: No specific naming requirements found - current implementation appears flexible

2. **Server Implementation**: Ensure MCP SDK compliance and proper error handling

3. **Transport Layer**: Verify stdio and websocket transport implementations

4. **Testing Strategy**: Continue with genuine MCP client testing approach

## Next Steps

1. Review any specific requirements found above
2. Test ALECS against official MCP clients
3. Validate transport layer compliance
4. Ensure proper error handling per MCP specification

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that
enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and
tools. Whether you’re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating
custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context
they need.
This specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the
TypeScript schema in
schema.ts.

modelcontextprotocol.io.
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD
NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “NOT RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14
[RFC2119]
[RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.
