# ALECS MCP Server Update: Version 1.3.5 - From Manual Clicks to Natural Language 🚀

Following up on my weekend project that lets you manage Akamai through natural language - ALECS has evolved significantly with v1.3.5!

## 🎉 Latest Release Highlights:

### 🆕 CP Code Automation & Production Activation (v1.3.4-5)
The property onboarding workflow is now COMPLETE:
```
"Hey, can you help me set up api.example.com on Akamai?"
```

ALECS now automatically:
- Creates CP Codes for traffic reporting and billing
- Detects web apps (api.*, www.*) and applies Ion Standard template
- Handles staging activation immediately (test in minutes!)
- Provides production activation guidance (10-60 min propagation)
- Supports natural language - no more memorizing parameters!

### 🎯 Complete Property Onboarding Automation (v1.3.3+)
What used to take 30+ minutes and 12 manual steps is now:
```
"Onboard code.example.com with origin backend.example.com"
```

ALECS handles everything:
- HTTPS-only configuration with Enhanced TLS
- Default DV certificate provisioning
- DNS CNAME + ACME challenge records
- CP Code creation with intelligent naming
- Ion Standard template for premium performance
- Staging activation with immediate testing
- Production activation agent for patient propagation
- Even guides you through DNS migration from AWS/Cloudflare/Azure!

### 🌳 Hierarchical Tree Views (v1.3.2)
No more flat property lists. Ask "show me properties in North America group" and get:
```
📁 North America (Group 12345)
│   └── 📦 www.example.com (v12, Active)
│
├── 📁 East Coast (Group 67890) - 6 properties
│   ├── 📦 api.example.com (v8, Active)
│   └── 📦 cdn.example.com (v15, Inactive)
```

### 🔧 Enhanced API Coverage (v1.3.1)
- Added 20+ optional parameters across Property Manager, Edge DNS, CPS, and Fast Purge
- Full feature parity with Akamai APIs
- Intelligent defaults to reduce configuration overhead

### 🏗️ TypeScript Migration (v1.3.0)
- Complete TypeScript rewrite with strict mode
- Modular architecture: 5 focused servers (property, DNS, certs, security, reporting)
- 198 tools across all services
- Interactive CLI for easy service selection

## Real World Example:
Just this week, I onboarded a new property with this conversation:
```
Me: "Set up code.solutionsedge.io on the CDN"
ALECS: "I'll help you set up code.solutionsedge.io on Akamai CDN with:
- Property name: code.solutionsedge.io
- Edge hostname: code.solutionsedge.io.edgekey.net
- Performance: Ion Standard with HTTP/3, caching, and acceleration
- Security: HTTPS-only with automatic redirect
- Certificate: Default DV (automatic provisioning)

This will take about 30 seconds to complete..."

[30 seconds later]

"✅ Property onboarding completed successfully!
Property ID: prp_123456
CP Code: 654321 (code-solutionsedge-io)
Edge Hostname: code.solutionsedge.io.edgekey.net
Activation: STAGING network

Next steps:
1. Test your configuration on staging
2. When ready for production: activate-property-production prp_123456"
```

## The Journey So Far:
From "weekend hack" to production-ready tool serving multiple teams. What started as frustration with repetitive tasks has become a comprehensive automation platform that handles:
- 198 tools across 5 service modules
- Complete property lifecycle management
- Natural language understanding
- Production-grade error handling

## What's Next:
- Security configuration workflows
- Multi-property bulk operations
- AI-powered optimization suggestions
- Visual property rule builder
- Terraform/Pulumi integration

## Try It Out:
```bash
npm install -g alecs-mcp-server-akamai
alecs
```

Or for Claude Desktop users:
```bash
alecs install property
# Then: "Hey Claude, use akamai-property to set up my new website"
```

## The Technical Details (for the curious):
- **CP Code Creation**: Automatically generates Content Provider Codes for traffic categorization
- **Ion Standard Detection**: Recognizes api.* and www.* patterns for optimal product selection
- **Production Activation Agent**: Handles the 10-60 minute DNS propagation gracefully
- **Natural Language Support**: No more JSON - just tell it what you want!

## Community Impact:
The response has been incredible! Teams are reporting:
- 95% reduction in property onboarding time
- Zero manual errors (no more typos in configurations!)
- Junior engineers onboarding properties like pros
- Senior engineers focusing on architecture instead of clicking

Special thanks to everyone who's contributed, tested, and provided feedback. This started as a weekend project but the community has made it so much more.

Still unofficial, still solving real problems, still open source.
