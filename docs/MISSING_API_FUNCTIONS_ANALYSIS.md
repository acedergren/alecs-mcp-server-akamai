### Phase 2 - Core Functionality (2-4 weeks)
1. CPS enrollment updates and deletion
2. AppSec rate policies
3. Bulk search operations
4. Certificate change management
5. DNS alias management

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)
1. API discovery and protection
2. Synchronous bulk operations
3. Advanced AppSec settings
4. Notification subscriptions
5. Complex search operations

### Phase 4 - Nice to Have (6+ weeks)
1. Schema validation endpoints

## Business Impact Summary

### Highest Impact Missing Functions:
1. **CPS Update/Delete** - Can't manage certificate lifecycle
2. **AppSec Rate Policies** - No DDoS protection management
3. **Custom Behaviors** - Can't see advanced configurations
4. **Fast Purge Delete** - Only invalidate, not delete
5. **API Protection** - No API-specific security

### User Experience Gaps:
1. No audit trails for compliance
2. Limited bulk operation visibility
3. Can't update existing resources (create-only)
4. No change history tracking
5. Limited search capabilities

### Competitive Disadvantage:
Without these functions, users must:
- Use Akamai Control Center for many operations
- Manually track changes and history
- Cannot automate complete workflows
- Limited visibility into configurations
- Cannot meet compliance requirements

---

## Conclusion

The current implementation covers approximately 60-70% of commonly used Akamai API operations. The missing 30-40% includes critical functions for:
- Complete resource lifecycle management
- Security and compliance
- Advanced configuration management
- Bulk operations and automation
- Audit and history tracking

Implementing the HIGH priority items would bring coverage to ~85-90% and address most user needs. The full implementation would provide comprehensive Akamai API coverage through the MCP interface.
