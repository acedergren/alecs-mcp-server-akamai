## üèÜ Issue #1: "Explain and Fix My Akamai Error" (HERO FEATURE)

**Title**: Implement intelligent error diagnosis and auto-fix system

**Labels**: `hero-feature`, `enhancement`, `ai-powered`, `priority:critical`

**Description**:
Create an AI-powered error diagnosis system that transforms cryptic Akamai errors into actionable solutions. This feature alone could save developers hundreds of hours.

**Core Functionality**:
```typescript
// User experience
await error.explain({
  error: "403 Forbidden: /property-manager/v1/properties",
  context: {
    operation: "property.create",
    parameters: { contractId: "ctr_C-0NTRACT", groupId: "grp_12345" }
  }
})

// Response
{
  "diagnosis": {
    "errorType": "PERMISSION_DENIED",
    "rootCause": "Your API credentials lack write access to contract ctr_C-0NTRACT",
    "details": "This contract belongs to account 'ACME-PROD' but your credentials are for 'ACME-DEV'"
  },
  "explanation": "You're trying to create a property in a contract that your API credentials cannot access. This usually happens when using credentials from a different environment or account.",
  "solutions": [
    {
      "description": "Use a contract you have access to",
      "action": "Run property.list-contracts to see available contracts",
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    {
      "description": "Switch to correct credentials",
      "action": "Use customer:'production' parameter if you have multi-account access",
      "confidence": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "autoFix": {
    "available": true,
    "suggestion": "Switch to contract ctr_D-IFFERENT which you have write access to",
    "command": "property.create with contractId:'ctr_D-IFFERENT'"
  }
}
```

**Error Types to Handle**:
- Permission errors (403/401)
- Contract/Group/Product mismatches
- Missing required products on contracts
- DNS validation failures
- Certificate domain validation errors
- Rate limiting errors
- Malformed rule JSON
- Activation conflicts
- Network list validation errors

**Implementation Requirements**:
- [ ] Error pattern database with known issues
- [ ] Context-aware diagnosis engine
- [ ] Solution recommendation system
- [ ] Auto-fix capability for common issues
- [ ] Learning system to improve over time

**Why This Is The #1 Hero Feature**:
- Akamai errors are the single biggest frustration
- Saves hours of debugging and support tickets
- Makes Akamai accessible to non-experts
- Provides immediate value in every session
- Creates "wow" moments when it auto-fixes issues

## üéØ Issue #2: "Zero-to-Edge" Onboarding Wizard

**Title**: Natural language website deployment wizard

**Labels**: `hero-feature`, `enhancement`, `onboarding`

**Description**:
Enable users to describe their website/app in plain English and automatically create all necessary Akamai configurations.

**User Experience**:
```typescript
await wizard.deploy({
  description: "I have a React app at origin.example.com that needs global CDN with SSL"
})

// Wizard performs:
// 1. Creates property with optimal caching rules
// 2. Sets up DNS zone with proper records
// 3. Generates DV certificate
// 4. Creates edge hostname
// 5. Provides deployment instructions
// 6. Monitors activation progress
```

**Features**:
- [ ] Natural language parsing
- [ ] Intelligent defaults based on app type
- [ ] Step-by-step progress tracking
- [ ] Rollback on any failure
- [ ] Export as reusable template

## üîç Issue #3: "Explain My Akamai Setup"

**Title**: Intelligent configuration explainer and visualizer

**Labels**: `hero-feature`, `enhancement`, `visualization`

**Description**:
Trace and explain how traffic flows through Akamai for any domain, in plain English.

**Example**:
```typescript
await explain.trace({ domain: "www.example.com" })

// Returns:
{
  "summary": "www.example.com uses Akamai's CDN with enhanced security",
  "flow": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "component": "DNS",
      "description": "www.example.com resolves to Akamai edge servers via CNAME",
      "details": "CNAME ‚Üí www.example.com.edgesuite.net"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "component": "Edge Server",
      "description": "Akamai edge serves cached content or fetches from origin",
      "details": "Cache TTL: 24 hours for images, 1 hour for HTML"
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "component": "Security",
      "description": "WAF rules block malicious requests",
      "details": "Blocking: SQL injection, XSS, rate limiting at 100 req/min"
    }
  ],
  "insights": [
    "üí° Your images could cache longer (currently 24h, recommended 30d)",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è No bot protection enabled - consider adding"
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Error Diagnosis (2-3 weeks)
Start with "Explain and Fix" as it provides immediate value

### Phase 2: Setup Explainer (1-2 weeks)  
Add configuration visualization and explanation

### Phase 3: Wizards (3-4 weeks)
Implement onboarding and bulk change wizards

### Phase 4: AI Insights (2-3 weeks)
Add performance and optimization recommendations

## Success Metrics

- **Error Resolution Time**: Reduce from hours to seconds
- **Onboarding Time**: Deploy new site in <5 minutes
- **User Satisfaction**: "This is magic!" responses
- **Support Tickets**: 50% reduction in Akamai-related issues
- **Adoption**: Used in 80%+ of Cursor sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Error Diagnosis Engine
```typescript
class AkamaiErrorDiagnostics {
  private patterns = new Map<string, ErrorPattern>();
  private contextAnalyzer = new ContextAnalyzer();
  private solutionEngine = new SolutionEngine();
  
  async diagnose(error: any, context: OperationContext) {
    // 1. Parse error structure
    const parsed = this.parseAkamaiError(error);
    
    // 2. Match against known patterns
    const matches = this.findPatterns(parsed);
    
    // 3. Analyze context
    const contextInsights = await this.contextAnalyzer.analyze(context);
    
    // 4. Generate solutions
    const solutions = await this.solutionEngine.generate(matches, contextInsights);
    
    // 5. Check for auto-fix possibilities
    const autoFix = await this.checkAutoFix(solutions, context);
    
    return {
      diagnosis: this.explainInPlainEnglish(matches, contextInsights),
      solutions,
      autoFix
    };
  }
}
```

These hero features would transform ALECS from a useful tool into an indispensable AI companion for Akamai development!
