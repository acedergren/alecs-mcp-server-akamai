I need you to act as a senior solutions architect and software engineer. Lets start planning for building a Akamai MCP server. We are going to develop it in four stages. Stage 1: Work with the Property Manager API to do CURD operations with CDN Configurations. For that we also need to mange certificates via Deafult DV and the CPS API Stage 2: Integrate FastPurge to be able to do purge content Stage 3: Integrate the Applicaiton Security API to be able to do CURD operations with WAF and other security features handled by that API. Stage: Reporting. I need you to be able to query the Reporting API to get metrics and stats about the delivery and ingest batches of events with the SIEM integration to be able to query regarding secuity events Deliver: I need the crompts for claude to t to do reaseach on the APIs needed to do this. And also for creating agents doing the Planning and architecure Staging of development Overall planning . I also need you to create prompt for the various stages the development for claude code to create and run agents for it simutainusly.  I also need to understand what infrastructure i need to run this. I prefer nodejs, typescript or python.

The purpose of the complete version is to enable customer to quickly setup a Day 0 enviroment for CDN and Secrity. Any other Akamai APIs you think I should consider for the first  version? MVP is to manged CDN Properties

I'm a 1 man team doing this as a hack on my spare time. So lets keep time lines and LOE resonable. KPIs etc is less important :)
