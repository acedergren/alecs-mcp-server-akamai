# Agent 2 Testing - Property Manager API Integration

## What Was Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Property Tools** (`src/tools/property-tools.ts`)
   - `listProperties` - Lists all properties with enhanced formatting
   - `getProperty` - Gets detailed property information including versions and hostnames
   - `createProperty` - Creates new properties with validation and guidance
   - `listGroups` - Lists groups hierarchically with contracts

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - User-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
   - Detailed property information including activation status
   - Hierarchical group display
   - Property organization by contract
   - Natural language response formatting
   - Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
   - Next-step guidance after operations

## Test Scenarios

### 1. List Properties
Test the enhanced property listing with filtering:
```
"Show me all my CDN properties"
"List properties in contract ctr_XXX"
"Show properties for group grp_XXX"
```

Expected: Well-formatted list with status indicators and organization by contract

### 2. Get Property Details
Test comprehensive property information:
```
"Give me details about property prp_12345"
"Show me the configuration for property prp_12345"
```

Expected: Detailed property info including versions, hostnames, and activation status

### 3. Create Property
Test property creation with validation:
```
"Create a new property called test-site in group grp_XXX with contract ctr_XXX"
```

Expected: Success with detailed next steps, or helpful validation errors

### 4. List Groups
Test hierarchical group display:
```
"What groups do I have access to?"
"Show me all available contracts"
```

Expected: Hierarchical group structure with contracts clearly displayed

## Response Format Examples

### Property List Format:
```

```

### Error Response Format:

## Natural Language Support

The implementation handles these user requests:
- "List all my CDN properties"
- "Show me details for property prp_12345"
- "Create a new property called 'my-website' in group grp_67890"
- "What groups do I have access to?"

## Error Handling

Common scenarios handled with helpful messages:
