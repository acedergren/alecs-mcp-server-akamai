## Description
Create and maintain a comprehensive library of known Akamai error patterns across all services, including causes, solutions, and real-world examples.

## Requirements

### Data Collection
- [ ] Gather error examples from all Akamai services
- [ ] Document error variations and edge cases
- [ ] Include real-world context and scenarios
- [ ] Track error frequency and impact

### Pattern Structure
```typescript
interface ErrorPatternLibrary {
  patterns: {
    // Property Manager Errors
    PM001: {
      service: 'property-manager',
      httpStatus: 403,
      title: 'Forbidden - No write access',
      variations: [
        'You do not have permission to access this resource',
        'Insufficient permissions for contract',
        'Write access denied for group'
      ],
      causes: [
        'API credentials lack write permission',
        'Contract not accessible to current account',
        'Group inheritance blocking access'
      ],
      solutions: ['PM001-SOL-1', 'PM001-SOL-2'],
      frequency: 'very-common',
      firstSeen: '2023-01-01',
      lastUpdated: '2024-12-01'
    },
    
    // DNS Errors
    DNS001: {
      service: 'edge-dns',
      httpStatus: 400,
      title: 'Invalid DNS record',
      variations: [
        'Invalid record data',
        'Record conflicts with existing entries',
        'CNAME and other records conflict'
      ],
      causes: [
        'CNAME record at apex',
        'Duplicate A records',
        'Invalid IP format'
      ],
      solutions: ['DNS001-SOL-1'],
      examples: [
        {
          request: { /* actual request */ },
          response: { /* actual error */ }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Service Coverage
- [ ] Property Manager (30+ patterns)
- [ ] Edge DNS (20+ patterns)
- [ ] Certificate Management (15+ patterns)
- [ ] Network Lists (10+ patterns)
- [ ] App Security (25+ patterns)
- [ ] Fast Purge (10+ patterns)
- [ ] Reporting (10+ patterns)

## Pattern Categories

### Permission/Authorization Errors
```yaml
PM001: No write access to contract
PM002: No read access to property
PM003: Account switching required
PM004: API key expired
PM005: Missing required API permissions
```

### Validation Errors
```yaml
PM010: Invalid property name format
PM011: Rule JSON validation failed
PM012: Missing required product
PM013: Invalid hostname format
DNS010: Invalid DNS record format
DNS011: CNAME at zone apex
CPS010: Domain validation failed
```

### Resource Conflicts
```yaml
PM020: Property name already exists
PM021: Activation already in progress
DNS020: Record already exists
NL020: Network list name conflict
```

### Quota/Limit Errors
```yaml
API001: Rate limit exceeded
API002: Activation queue full
PM030: Property limit reached
DNS030: Record limit exceeded
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up error logging system
- [ ] Gather historical error data
- [ ] Interview support team for common issues
- [ ] Analyze customer tickets

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis (Week 2)
- [ ] Categorize errors by service and type
- [ ] Identify error variations
- [ ] Document root causes
- [ ] Map to existing solutions

### Phase 3: Library Creation (Week 3)
- [ ] Build pattern database schema
- [ ] Import analyzed patterns
- [ ] Create pattern matching rules
- [ ] Add solution mappings

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Monitor new error patterns
- [ ] Update existing patterns
- [ ] Track pattern effectiveness
- [ ] Gather user feedback

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Pattern matching accuracy tests
- [ ] Coverage tests (% of errors matched)
- [ ] Performance tests (lookup speed)
- [ ] Version compatibility tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 150+ documented error patterns
- [ ] 90%+ coverage of common errors
- [ ] Each pattern has 2+ solutions
- [ ] Real examples for each pattern
- [ ] Searchable and maintainable format

## Maintenance Plan
- Monthly review of new patterns
- Quarterly solution effectiveness review
- API version compatibility updates
- User feedback integration

## Dependencies
- Access to Akamai error logs
- Support team collaboration
- Customer error reports
- API documentation
